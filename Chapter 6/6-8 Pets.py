# Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a pet. In each dictionary, include the
# kind of animal and the owner’s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and
# as you do print everything you know about each pet.
# Note: When I decided to post solutions and wrote complete programs to solve each exercise, I realized this problem was
# not as well phrased as it should have been. It doesn’t really make sense to name each dictionary for the pet it describes; that information should really be included in the dictionary, rather than being used as the name of the dictionary. This solution reflects that approach.
